### Description
Where The Wall Opens is a narrative horror game that requires you to navigate Josh’s nightmares and avoid the darkness that dwells there. In the process, you will find that hiding from the darkness only buys a bit of time, running from it can be futile, and facing it head on can be downright impossible. Discover what is hiding within Josh’s subconscious as he struggles to escape something he desperately wants to ignore.
